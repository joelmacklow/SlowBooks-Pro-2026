# New Zealand Localization Summary

This document captures the current localization audit for turning SlowBooks Pro 2026 into a New Zealand-localized version.

The `nz-localization` branch is now the authoritative SlowBooks NZ product branch. Treat it as a New Zealand-localized product fork, not as a light patch set over the US-shaped upstream. See `docs/nz-fork-policy.md` for branch roles and upstream-sync rules.

## Assessment

The app is strongly US-shaped in tax, payroll, addresses, reports, PDF/UI copy, seed data, and import/export behavior. The broad direction from the external review is accurate, but the code audit found several additional surfaces that need attention:

- Purchase-side and sales-side GST now post through a single `2200 GST` control account. The account balance represents GST owing to or from Inland Revenue, following the Xero-style single GST account model.
- Import/export paths are a major localization surface. CSV and IIF logic use State/ZIP conventions, QuickBooks-style address parsing, and "Sales Tax Payable" labels.
- GST calculation is now centralized for invoices, bills, credit memos, purchase orders, estimates, and generated recurring invoices.
- Document forms now use line-level GST codes for GST calculation. The legacy `default_tax_rate` setting still exists for compatibility, but it is no longer the GST design for NZ documents.
- Upstream added shared report period UI for several reports. Reuse that flow for GST returns instead of building a separate date picker.
- Posted invoice updates now reverse the prior journal entry and post a replacement when lines are changed. Invoice duplication, estimate-to-invoice conversion, and purchase-order-to-bill conversion now route through the normal posting paths so converted/duplicated documents carry balanced journal entries.
- A small `tests/` directory now exists for settings localization. GST, reporting, and payroll changes still need focused regression tests before implementation.
- Schema changes need Alembic migrations under `alembic/versions`.

## Official NZ Anchors

Use official Inland Revenue and ACC material when implementing the localized behavior:

- Inland Revenue GST overview: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst>
- Inland Revenue charging GST: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/gst/charging-gst>
- Inland Revenue claiming GST: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/en/gst/claiming-gst>
- Inland Revenue payday filing paper information: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/employing-staff/payday-filing/filing-employment-information-by-paper>
- Inland Revenue PAYE file upload specification 2026: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/digital-service-providers/payday-filing-file-upload-specification-2026.pdf?modified=20250804033830>
- Inland Revenue KiwiSaver employee deduction rates: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-for-employers/contributions-and-deductions/update-employee-deduction-rate-for-kiwisaver>
- Inland Revenue KiwiSaver employer contributions: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/kiwisaver/kiwisaver-for-employers/contributions-and-deductions/employer-contributions-to-kiwisaver-and-complying-funds>
- Inland Revenue ACC levy rates: <https://www.ird.govt.nz/acclevy>

Key design facts from those sources:

- GST is charged at `15%`.
- For GST-inclusive prices, the GST component is calculated as `3/23` of the GST-inclusive price.
- GST payable/refundable is based on output tax less input tax.
- Payroll should align with current payday filing / Employment Information processes, not legacy US-style withholding.
- PAYE tax codes include codes such as `M`, `ME`, `S`, `SH`, `ST`, `SA`, and `SL` variants.
- KiwiSaver employee contribution rates are listed as `3.5%`, `4%`, `6%`, `8%`, or `10%`, with employer contributions generally at least `3%`.
- ACC earners' levy is part of PAYE calculations for ordinary PAYE wages; the app should still version rates/caps carefully.

## Confirmed Code Gaps

### Settings

Settings are stored as key-value rows and the API only accepts keys listed in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`.

Relevant files:

- `app/models/settings.py`
- `app/routes/settings.py`
- `app/static/js/settings.js`

NZ fields have been added to defaults and surfaced in the settings UI. Keep expanding this foundation through tests when other areas begin consuming localization settings.

### Currency And Dates

Currency and date formatting now has a shared foundation:

- `app/services/formatting.py` provides Python currency and date helpers driven by company settings.
- PDF invoice, estimate, statement, and invoice email rendering use the shared Python formatting path.
- `app/static/js/utils.js` provides frontend currency and date helpers driven by `App.settings`.
- Existing report, transaction, dashboard, settings, and company-list UI callers use the shared frontend helper path for known currency/date display.

### GST Calculation

Tax is currently invoice-level rather than line-level. `Item.is_taxable` exists, but invoice total calculation ignores it.

Relevant files:

- `app/models/items.py`
- `app/models/invoices.py`
- `app/routes/invoices.py`
- `app/routes/estimates.py`
- `app/routes/bills.py`
- `app/routes/credit_memos.py`
- `app/routes/purchase_orders.py`
- `app/services/recurring_service.py`
- `app/static/js/invoices.js`
- `app/static/js/estimates.js`
- `app/static/js/purchase_orders.js`
- `app/static/js/recurring.js`

Document forms now load GST codes and use line-level GST logic for frontend previews and save payloads. Keep new GST UI work aligned with that path rather than reintroducing document-level tax-rate calculation.

### GST Posting

The app uses account `2200 GST` as the GST control account. Sales/output GST credits this account; purchase/input GST and credit memo reversals debit this account. Settlement/payment workflows remain separate work.

Posted invoice line edits reverse the original journal and post a replacement journal so account balances track recalculated line-level GST. Invoice duplication, estimate conversion, and purchase order conversion reuse normal invoice/bill creation paths so their journals are posted consistently. Bill voids now share the generic reversal helper and closing-date guard.

Relevant files:

- `app/services/accounting.py`
- `app/routes/invoices.py`
- `app/routes/bills.py`
- `app/routes/credit_memos.py`
- `app/services/recurring_service.py`
- `app/seed/chart_of_accounts.py`

### Payroll

Payroll employee setup now uses an NZ-focused field set for IRD number, tax code, KiwiSaver, student loan, child support, ESCT, pay frequency, start/end dates, and a per-pay child support amount. The Payroll page now supports draft pay runs using versioned NZ PAYE rules, calculates PAYE/ACC/student loan/KiwiSaver/ESCT/child support values, posts processed runs into NZ payroll liability accounts, generates payslip PDFs for processed pay runs, exports per-run Employment Information CSV files for IRD upload, supports starter/leaver employee filing, and now records filing audit/history state with generated/filed/amended/superseded tracking plus changed-since-filing detection.

The platform now also has a reusable authentication/RBAC foundation with session login, bootstrap/login/logout/user-management UX, role-based memberships, permission overrides, and protected payroll/employee/admin routes. Payroll is the first enforced protected domain, and core admin surfaces now use the same RBAC model; broader rollout to the remaining business modules still remains follow-up work.

Runtime system-account selection now resolves from explicit settings-backed roles with legacy fallback for key posting/default-selection paths, and fresh seed/bootstrap flows populate those role mappings automatically. This allows the branch default chart to move away from the old QB contractor numbering without breaking posting/default-account behavior.

Relevant files:

- `app/models/payroll.py`
- `app/schemas/payroll.py`
- `app/routes/payroll.py`
- `app/routes/employees.py`
- `app/services/nz_payroll.py`
- `app/static/js/payroll.js`
- `app/static/js/employees.js`

### Addresses

Customer and vendor records previously defaulted to `US` and used State/ZIP labels; the NZ branch now presents Region/Postcode wording while preserving storage compatibility.

Relevant files:

- `app/models/contacts.py`
- `app/schemas/contacts.py`
- `app/static/js/customers.js`
- `app/static/js/vendors.js`
- `app/static/js/settings.js`
- `app/templates/invoice_pdf.html`
- `app/templates/invoice_pdf_v2.html`
- `app/templates/estimate_pdf.html`
- `app/templates/statement_pdf.html`
- `app/templates/invoice_email.html`

Address labels and defaults now have a compatibility-preserving NZ foundation: customer/vendor create defaults use `NZ`, company/customer/vendor forms show `Region` and `Postcode`, document address lines use NZ city/region/postcode formatting, CSV export uses `Region`/`Postcode`, and CSV import accepts both the NZ headers and legacy `State`/`ZIP`. Database/API field names are still unchanged for compatibility.

### Tax Reporting

Schedule C storage and legacy code paths still exist, but the NZ branch now disables the active Schedule C routes and removes the Tax Reports navigation entry so US income-tax output is no longer exposed to end users.

The general reports UI now includes reusable period selection and custom date handling in `app/static/js/reports.js`. The legacy sales-tax surface is now an NZ GST Return report that produces GST101A box values, can generate a filled GST101A April 2023 PDF, and now surfaces bank-confirmed GST settlement state by matching reconciled bank transactions to GST periods. Box 9 and Box 13 adjustment values are entered at report-generation time, and the selected GST accounting basis comes from Company Settings.

Relevant files:

- `app/models/tax.py`
- `app/routes/tax.py`
- `app/services/tax_export.py`
- `app/static/js/tax.js`
- `README.md`

### Import And Export

CSV export now uses NZ-facing headers where SlowBooks owns the format, and the QuickBooks IIF surfaces now keep QB2003 wire compatibility while exporting/importing against the current NZ GST/address/account assumptions instead of stale US-facing sales-tax presentation.

Relevant files:

- `app/services/csv_import.py`
- `app/services/csv_export.py`
- `app/services/iif_import.py`
- `app/services/iif_export.py`
- `app/static/js/iif.js`

## Remaining Todo

1. Keep NZ fork hygiene clean:
   Continue treating `nz-localization` as the canonical SlowBooks NZ branch. Do not reintroduce US tax, payroll, reporting, address, or seed-data behavior without an explicit product decision.

2. Maintain NZ-first foundations as new slices land:
   Reuse the existing NZ settings, formatting helpers, GST model/calculation stack, system-account role mappings, and Alembic bootstrap path rather than creating branch-specific alternatives.

3. Finish payroll address/schema cleanup:
   Company, customer, and vendor address labeling is now NZ-first, but payroll employee address fields and any deeper schema renames are still deferred follow-up work.

4. Decide and implement the NZ income-tax replacement surface:
   Schedule C is retired on the NZ branch, but the replacement output still needs a product decision: IR3 business summary, IR10-style financial statements, accountant export, or another NZ-specific output.

5. Extend platform RBAC beyond the current payroll/admin rollout:
   The platform now has reusable auth UX plus RBAC enforcement for payroll, employee, settings, accounts, backups, audit, and companies. Remaining work is to extend the same model across the rest of the business modules and any future multi-company context switching.

6. Keep expanding focused regression coverage:
   Continue adding targeted tests whenever localized behavior changes, especially around GST math/reporting, GST settlement matching, posting lifecycle integrity, payroll calculations/outputs, filing history state, and settings-driven behavior.

7. Decide multi-currency scope explicitly:
   The branch currently assumes single-currency `NZD` formatting. Full multi-currency support remains a separate accounting feature involving exchange rates, realized gains/losses, account currencies, and reporting currency.
